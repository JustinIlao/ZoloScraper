# ZoloScraper

A web scraper that pulls the address and city from pages on the site zolo, then uses googles api to obtain a postal code for each address.
Was initially built to only pull info from townhouses and houses but the code can be easily modified for other parameters.

## How to Use
Download chromedriver version that matches your chrome browser version (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads , chrome://version/) and set the correct path to your chromedriver.
Fill in your zolo email and pin, as well as your google api key.
